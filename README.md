Solvable Qubit Hamiltonians

Author: Smik Patel (smik.patel@mail.utoronto.ca)

This repository contains codes for various exactly solvable qubit Hamiltonian types described in arXiv:2402.09376, including 
implementations of the solving unitaries as well as implementation of the decomposition algorithm of a general qubit Hamiltonian
into solvable fragments. 

This package uses NumPy, SciPy, Openfermion, and NetworkX.
