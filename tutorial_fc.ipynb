    "Such a Hamiltonian can be written as a polynomial function of a set of algebraically independent, mutually commuting generators $\\overline{C} = \\{C_0,\\ldots,C_{K-1}\\}$. This statement means two things. First: the term \"algebraically independent\" means that none of the generators $C_k$ can be written as a product, up to a phase, of the other generators $C_l, l\\not=k$. Second: each Pauli term in $H$ can be written as a product, up to a phase, of the full set of generators $\\overline{C}$:\n",
